<a name="purpose"></a>
## 1. Purpose
Nyckepharpa is a user created Hubitat Home Security Monitor (HSM) extension, providing features not available in HSM. Additionally, it simplifies setting up security related messaging. 

[:arrow_up_small: Back to top](#top)

<a name="features"></a>
## 2. Features<br />
All features are optional, you may use whatever app features you choose. For Example: Forced Arming only. Keypads not required.

* HSM arming when a contact is open, with easy user control<br /> 
Why is this needed? HSM does not arm the system when arming alerts are implemented, and a contact is open. Examples:<br /><br />It's 1AM, you want to arm the system for night, but a contact is broken.<br /><br />You are away from home, forgot to arm the system, and when you try, oops the back door is open. 
* Adjusts Hubitat's mode when HSM's arm state changes. (HSM adjusts HSM's arm state when the mode changes)
* Provides an easy to use security related message control center with output to TTS, Speakers, and Notification devices such as: Hubitat PhoneApp and Pushover

* Keypads: App works with Hubitat keypad drivers, or the user provided Centalitex keypad driver. <b>*However do not mix user and system keypad drivers*</b>
1. Using Centralitex Keypad driver:<br /><br />
*Supports Centralite/Xfinity 3400, Centalite 3400-G, Iris V2 and V3, and UEI devices* using a ported version of Mitch Pond's SmartThings Keypad DH, making he keypad function as it did in SmartThings with the SHM Delay App*<br /><br />
*Pins: App provided Pin maintenance module with available Panic pins, burnable pins aka maximum use count, restricted date and time, and restricted keypad devices; or Hubitat's Lock Manager App Pins*<br /><br />
*Keys make sounds when tapped*<br /><br />
*Arming forced message supported*

2. Using Hubitat Keypad drivers:<br /><br /> 
*Supports Centralite/Xfinity 3400, Centalite 3400-G, Iris V2 and V3 devices*.<br /><br /> 
*Pins: Only Lock Manager pins are supported when using this driver*.<br /><br /> 
*Generally no sound when keys are tapped*<br /><br /> 
*Arming forced message not supported*

* Keypad Panic Alerts:

1. Using Centralitex Keypad driver: When the keypad's Panic key is pressed, or a Panic Pin is entered, and there a properly configured active HSM Custom Panic rule<br /> 
*The system immediately executes the custom HSM rule's alert functions in all arming states, including when HSM is disarmed*

2. Using Hubitat Keypad drivers: When the keypad's Panic key is pressed, and there a properly configured active HSM Custom Panic rule<br /> 
*The system immediately executes the custom HSM rule's alert functions in all arming states, including when HSM is disarmed. Without Nyckelharpa and it's custom panic rule, HSM does not respond to panic when it is disarmed.*

* Door Chime Function: Use with Keypads and other devices supporting the "beep" command. Optionally issues beep command when system is Disarmed and selected contact sensor opens. Also can optionally issue beep commands when system is armed and Entry Delay begins. Note: the created sound varies by device type, and when using Iris V2/V3 by firmware version.

## 7. Forced Arming, Adjust HSM Settings.

Forced Arming is a two step process: An standard initial HSM arming that fails normally, followed by a second arming within 15 seconds that forces HSM to arm. It works from any arming source, including: keypads, locks, dashboards, and the HSM app

1. Required Basic Setup: 
* Follow instrucions in Section 6 above, generating the NCKL-child-contact-sensors 

2. Setup HSM's devices for Forced Arming: 
* In Intrusion-Away, Intrusion-Home, and Intrusion-Night, "Contact Sensors": replace the real contact-sensor-name(s) with the virtual NCKL-contact-sensor-name(s)
* In "Configure/Arming/Disarming/Cancel Options", "Delay only for selected doors": replace the real contact-sensor-name(s) with the virtual NCKL-contact-sensor-name(s)

3. How to Force Arm, a two step process: Arming that fails normally, then Arming again within 15 seconds
* Arm system as you would normally. When there is an open contact sensor monitored by Nyckelharpa, the system will not arm as is normal for HSM
* At the initial arm fail: any defined keypads beep twice, Talker issues an alert message including the open sensor(s) and the 15 second forced rearm time 
* Arming the system again, after a minimum of 3 seconds, to a maximum of 15 seconds from the initial arming failure, forces the HSM system to Arm. When using the Centralitex Keypad driver an "Arming Forced" message is issued.
  
[:arrow_up_small: Back to top](#top)
<a name="modefix"></a>
## 8. Modefix setup and usage

Modefix processes HSM armState changes, and optionally sets the Hubitat HSM mode. _It must be created even when the optional mode change data is empty._ 

(Optional) For each armState set:
* all valid modes for the armState
* the default mode for the armState

Caution: improper armState/mode choices, creates havoc with the system.

[:arrow_up_small: Back to top](#top)

1. In order to get the Nyckelharpa contacts open message and forced arming when using the HE Keypad drivers: you must create some sort of alert in HSM's Configure Arming/Disarming/Cancel --> Configure Alerts for Arming Failures (contacts open) section, or HSM arms directly, ignoring all open contacts. Should you be using TTS messages, simply place the word "Warning" into Arming Alerts-->Audio Alerts setting on the same speech output devices used with Nyckelharpa. It will speak prior to Nyckelharpa's Arming Canceled Open Contact message.

## 10. Keypad Device Handler

The app's Keypad Device Handler was created by Mitch Pond on SmartThings where it is still used by a few Smartapps including SHM Delay. With Mitch's assistance and Zigbee skills it was ported to HE, then I added the Alarm capability that sounds a fast high pitch tone until set off on the Iris V2, and beeps for 255 seconds on the Centralite. 

_This DH may be used with the Centralite/Xfinity 3400, Centralite 3400-G, Iris V2, Iris V3 and UEI keypads_

1. After installing the keypad DH, edit keypad devices changing Type to Centralitex Keypad, Save Device

2. Remove keypads using Centralitex driver from HSM. In HSM section Configure Arming/Disarming/Cancel Options --> Use keypad(s) to arm/disarm: optionally remove keypads using the Centralitex driver.

3. Add keypad to Nyckelharpa Global Settings

4. When using Nyckelharpa pins: Create User pin profiles. When using an Iris V3 User pin code 0000 is required and used for instant arming, but will not disarm. This keypad does not send a pin, even if entered, when arming.

5. When using Lock Manager Pins: in this device's setting set "Use Lock Manager Pins" on, save settings

5. Create HSM Custom Panic Rule

6. When using an Iris V2/V3 keypad set if Partial key creates Home (default) or Night arming mode

[:arrow_up_small: Back to top](#top)
<a name="userpin"></a>
## 11. Nyckelharpa User pin profiles with Centralitex Keypad driver 

When using the app's keypad Device Handler
* For each valid user pin, create a User pin profile

* Pin codes may be restricted by date/time, use count (burnable pins), and keypad device

* To use the Iris V2's instant arming, no pin required, create a User profile with pin code 0000. It is not accepted for OFF

* *The Iris V3 requires a User profile with pin code 0000, or it will not arm.* It is not accepted for OFF.

* You may define "Panic Pins" designed for use on keypads without a Panic key, but may be used on any keypad

[:arrow_up_small: Back to top](#top)

<a name="panicrules"></a>
## 12. Create Custom HSM Panic Rule

*A custom HSM Rule is required* to force an HSM response to a Panic key press, or Panic pin entry, enabling an instant Panic response even when the system is disarmed

1. Click on Apps-->then click Hubitat Safety Monitor 

2. Click on Custom

3. Click Create New Monitoring Rule --> Name this Custom Monitoring Rule-- enter Panic -->

4. Rule settings
What kind of device do you want to use: select Contact Sensor<br />
Select Contact Sensors: *check the Keypad Devices using Centralitex Keypad Driver, and %prfx%-Panic Id device when using HE drivers*, click Update<br />
What do you want to monitor?: Set Sensor Opens on/true<br />
Set Alerts for Text, Audio, Siren and Lights<br />
Click the "Arm This Rule" button<br />
Click Done

5. Do a Panic test: Press the Iris keypad's Panic button, on Centralite 3400-G simultaneously press both "Police Icon" buttons,  or enter a Panic pin number on Centralite 3400 / UEI.

6. The Panic Alert may be stopped by entering a valid user pin on Centralite / UEI, or a valid pin and OFF on an Iris; or the "Cancel Alerts" button from HE App HSM options

[:arrow_up_small: Back to top](#top)
<a name="testing"></a>
## 13. Debugging
1. No entry delay tones on keypad<br />
Keypad may be selected as an Optional Alarm device. Remove it as an Alarm device

2. No exit delay tones<br />
Create and save a Modefix profile

3. Forced arming does not occur<br />
A user reported the Snapshot app somehow interfered with Nyclelharpa's forced arming, and removing or disabling Snapshot fixed the issue. This does not make sense to me, merely reporting what I was told by the user.

[:arrow_up_small: Back to top](#top)
<a name="dboard"></a>
## 14. Arming From Dashboard
* Always arm and disarm using HSM Status. Forced arming is supported and alert messages are created. 

* Mode will generally work, however when there is an alert, the mode remains in the entered mode, but the HSM Status does not change.

[:arrow_up_small: Back to top](#top)

<a name="uninstall"></a>
## 15. Uninstalling
1. If using forced arming, change HSM settings NCKL-child devices to real devices<br />
2. If using Panic Key or Panic pins, remove custom Panic rule from HSM<br />
3. it is now safe to remove Nyckelharpa, child devices are deleted during removal process

[:arrow_up_small: Back to top](#top)

## 16. Get Help, report an issue, and contact information
* [Use the HE Community's Nyckelharpa forum](https://community.hubitat.com/t/release-nyckelharpa/15062) to request assistance, or to report an issue. Direct private messages to user @arnb

[:arrow_up_small: Back to top](#top)

<a name="issues"></a>
## 17. Known Issues
* Messages need individual custom destination settings

* SMS was disabled by Hubitat, but is still defined as a destination. Do not use SMS

* Iris V3 Keypad Issue: Lights remain on when device is sitting upright on a table or flat surface.<br /> 
Cause: Keypad's motion or proximity sensor is activated.<br /> 
Solution: Move keypad to edge of table, lay it flat on table or surface, or mount it on a wall.
